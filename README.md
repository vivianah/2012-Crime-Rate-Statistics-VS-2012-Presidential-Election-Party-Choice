# SI 330: Data Manipulation Final Course Project

This was my final project for SI 330 taken junior year.

This project was to assess party choice for the 2012 presidential election in terms of crime reates and median household income per state.

**Goal** 
- To see if a relationship between crime rates and party choice existed
- To see if the median household income also played a factor in that relationship.

**Data Sources Used**
- FBI Crime Rates per US State for 2012
- 2012 Election Results 
- 2012 Census Household Median Income per US State

**Method**
- Collecting data via webscraping, cleaning data, and joining it together to produce plotly visualizations
